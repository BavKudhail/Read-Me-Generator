  ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)


  ## The Motivation
  When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. The ReadMe generator will allow the developer to spend more time on code and less on the read me. 


  ## Description
  The goal is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input.
